## Problem

This is David Lee's solution to Insight Data Science's [Inverted Index Coding Challenge](https://github.com/Samariya57/coding_challenges/blob/master/challenge.pdf). The task aims to:

> ... find a way to easily search information in documents from keywords, [which will be accomplished using] vector representation of documents. One challenge is ... building an **inverted index** of the documents to speed up calculations.
>
> There are two deliverables:
>
> 1. Using a distributed computing engine, implement a job to build the dictionnary [sic].Every line of the output file will be word and its id. In the documens of the given dataset the words are separated by one or multiple spaces.
> 2. Implement one or multiple jobs to build the inverted index.

## Solution Overview

Given the requirement that my solution must run on a distributed system, the solutions are implemented using Apache Spark. For maximum performance, my solution is implemented in _Scala_.

[FIXME: create a solution.]

## Deployment

[FIXME: create content for the deployment]
